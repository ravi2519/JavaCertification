# Java 11 Certification

Hi there! So this is a full resource guide for my attempt to get Java 11 Certified.


# Old Rules

So i started my journey to get certified in Java 11 to receive **Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer** credentials.
Before October 1, 2020 it was fairly a two step process:

 - [Take a 815 exam](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-815)
 - [And a 816 exam](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-816)

Both costs approximately **11,300 INR** each and covers different set of syllabus.

You have to purchase the exam voucher from Oracle for each one of these. The voucher will be valid for next 6 months. And during this period you can schedule the exam anytime.

I did that too, but as soon as i was prepared to give 815, THE Oracle changed the game. They were retiring both 815 and 816 in favor of 819.

## New girl in town!!

Yes that's true! I broke up with both 815 and 816 after seeing how cool is 819.

## Few features of this new exam
- This is a 90 min exam as compared to 180 min ( for 815 and 816 each ).
- It costs approximately **11,300 INR**, which is good since now you have to shell just half the money! 
- Covers almost all the topics form 815 and 816 with few exceptions. Checkout [819](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-developer/pexam_1Z0-819) link for detailed syllabus.

## Important Topics

### Stream, Lambdas and Funtional Interfaces 
- [Stream API Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html)
- [Stream Operations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps)
- [Stream Tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-streams)
- [Processing Data with Java SE 8 Streams](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams.html)
- [Method detail of Object class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html)
  This is important because many times we are asked to identify a Function Interface and an inteface with no abstract method and a Object class method is not a function interface.
